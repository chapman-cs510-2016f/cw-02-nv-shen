### INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
# Note: you don't have to put exit 0 at the end, since it's the default behavior
# Following UNIX philosophy, only do things when they mean something, and try
# not to repeat work that has already been done. Defaults should be used when
# possible. (This is also known as the "principle of least surprise".)
